_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._

## Instructions

This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches

The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`, followed by either `b` or `e` to indicate "beginning" and "end", respectively. For example, the branch named `02_03e` corresponds to the solution video for the challenge presented in the second chapter as the third video in that chapter.

| Solution: Analyze a messy CSV file  | [`03_03e`](https://github.com/LinkedInLearning/rust-for-java-developers-2484214/tree/03_03e) |
| Challenge: Count words with map/reduce | [`04_04b`](https://github.com/LinkedInLearning/rust-for-java-developers-2484214/tree/04_04b) |

. The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.
